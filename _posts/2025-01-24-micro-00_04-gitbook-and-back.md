Spent a couple of hours trying to move this wiki to Gitbook and setup a bunch of groups and pages there, only to return to this non-tracking simple site.

Some context. The need of a laptop to be able to write and publish notes and micros seems to be creating friction in actively writing and maintaining this website. So I started looking into a few alternatives. Gitbook turned out to be one of the most convenient ones. But I want to keep things simple and non-tracking. It seems Gitbook tracks cookies. It made me uneasy. There are already enough pop-ups all around the web. I want my website to be a calm one. So I am back here again.

Also, I couldn't figure out a good way to post micros like this in the Gitbook setup.
