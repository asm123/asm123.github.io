### Ramping up on a new codebase

1. Understand expectations of a piece of code from its unit tests  
2. Send requests to the service
   1. What is expected in the request
   2. Which requests succeed
   3. Which requests fail
   4. Try different combinations, intentionally send invalid requests, how do responses differ
3. Find which systems it talks to using logs
4. Look up triggered code from the logs

### Ramping up on a new product area

1. Try the product yourself
2. Skim launch reports
3. What metrics mattered in the launches?
4. What were the tradeoffs?
5. Find design docs
6. Skim design docs and identify key decisions
7. Who were the collaborators on the docs?
8. What other things are the collaborators working on?
