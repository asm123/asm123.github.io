It's been over 3 months now since I properly moved to Switzerland for work. Now is as good a time as any to jot down my initial observations and reflections.

### Living situation

I live in a small town in a low-tax canton and work in the super-expensive Zürich. My house overlooks Lake Zürich in the front and green mountains in the backyard.

Nature is so close here. There are so many hiking trails around. Just 15-20 minutes train/bus ride away. Sometimes not even that far. I got lost on my way to somewhere urban once and ended up crossing a small hill full of fall colors!

### Transportation

This is what I love the most here. More than the nature. More than the proximity to nature. Switzerland has wonderful connectivity by train. And most of the last mile is connected by bus. Departure times of buses are synced to the arrival times and vice versa of major trains.

### Food

Indian food here is not great in general, except for one place where Veg Biryani was almost as delicious as back home. Rest is ok. Sometimes it is tough to find vegetarian breakfast at the office. When I say vegetarian, I mean vegetarian that does not include egg.

Cheese is omnipresent. Meat too. There is some kind of cheese which has beef. What!? 

Chocolate is delicious. So many types of chocolates! I love [Cailler](https://www.cailler.ch).

### People

I have so far spoken with only one of my neighbours so far and that was "Happy New Year" on January 1st. Other times, whenever I go to the balcony, their huge dog that looks like a lion (maybe a Tibetan Mastiff) starts barking at me. Which then leads to the neighbour coming to their balcony to see what is going on, a chuckle and the dog is taken inside. They have two dogs and both seem to be not very happy looking at people which do not reside in their house.

That said, people in my town seem to be friendly. Everyone except the younger generation greet everyone they see on the street with a "Grüezi". Keeping this up was quite difficult for me in the beginning. Now I am a "Grüezi" person too!

Dogs are seen everywhere. Not strays, but pets. More than one per family. Cats don't seem that common though. Unlike dogs, they are perhaps stray. I see them galloping sometimes in the fields.

People here smoke. A lot. This is the most smoke per square km I have seen anywhere. I wonder why.

Oh, and there is always some festival going on somewhere. People here celebrate everything. Summer, fall, winter. [Pumpkin festival](https://swissfamilyfun.com/juckerfarm/), [turnip festival](https://www.vvrs.ch/arbeitsgruppen/raebechilbi), [cattle ascent to Alps](https://madeinbern.com/en/experiences/year-round/events/top-cultural-events/alpine-cattle-processions), [cattle descent from Alps](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/summer-autumn/autumn/cattle-descent-from-alpine-pastures/), Christmas markets, parades. These people find so many reasons to celebrate :)

### At work

My colleagues are usually not online after maybe 6:30pm or so, only occasionally. This is a huge difference from what I have experienced so far back home. 

Despite that, they tend to seem to get almost the same amount of work done during the typical office hours. Efficiency.

Also, they don't sugarcoat things. Especially while talking about work.

Coffee after lunch seems to be a norm.

### Weather

Oh the Swiss weather. It keeps raining so much these days, No wonder it is green all year round. There was one whole week in December when clouds descended at the level of my doorstep on the 2nd floor. It was so cold and grey! It snowed heavily for a couple of days in November. That was my first snowfall! The world around was monochrome for a week after that, but so beautiful!

These days, it is not very cold. Just 2-6 degrees. Huh. I used to shiver below 20 degrees earlier. Now having experienced temperatures below 0 degree for days during December, 6 degrees sure feels better. Tired of having to wear so many layers every time I have to step out now though. Eagerly looking forward to the summer!

### Tourism

Switzerland is the dream destination for a lot of Indians, thanks to DDLJ. I had no such dream tbh. But when I arrived here first, I fell in love with the nature here. And that led to many travels since I formally moved here for work. Easy hikes around Zürich on weekends, snowy mountains during Christmas holidays and many more being planned :)

That's all for now. Maybe I will do another round after a few more months.
