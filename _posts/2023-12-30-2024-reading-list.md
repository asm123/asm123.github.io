I had set the target of reading 12 books in 2023 and [managed to meet](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/46041049) it! In 2024, I am hoping to get to 15 books.

### Resuming from 2023

* **Technical**
  * [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) - Martin Kleppmann
    * Seems like a structured way to improve system design skills.

* **Leadership**
  * [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) - Tanya Reilly - [notes](/staff-engineers-path)
    * Senior to staff is a big and difficult change. This seems like a great guide to build the necessary skills.

* **History**
  * [Kohinoor: The Story of the World’s Most Infamous Diamond](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33391999-kohinoor) - William Dalrymple, Anita Anand
    * Loved William Dalrymple's writing in  "City of Djinns". Want to read more of his work.


### To-read list

* **Leadership**
  * [Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy) - Richard P. Rumelt
    * Referenced in ["The Staff Engineer's Path"](/staff-engineers-path) and other tech leadership articles multiple times.

* **Science**
  * [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) - Donald A. Norman
    * Found in [Maggie Appleton's library](https://maggieappleton.com/library).

* **Memoir**
  * [The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144405196-the-worlds-i-see) - Fei-Fei Li
    * Fei-Fei Li is a prominent figure in AI space. I haven't read much from women in STEM recently. This may be a great read for inspiration.
  * [Why Didn’t You Come Sooner? Compassion in Action: Stories of Children Rescued From Slavery](https://amzn.eu/d/3AhgEZq) - Kailash Satyarthi
    * This may be a difficult read given the seriousness of content. Want to read more books in Indian context.
  * [My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57499853-my-life-in-full) - Indra Nooyi
    * Indra Nooyi has been a role model and inspirational person for me since childhood. Want to know how she did it all.

* **Technology**
  * [Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war)
    * Recommended by Dr. Raghuram Rajan in 2023 year end special segment in TOI!

* **Psychology**
  * [How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42771901-how-to-do-nothing) - Jenny Odell
    * Maybe will help me with the burnout.
  * [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan) - Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    * Have become a fan of Taleb's way of thinking since reading "Fooled by Randomness". Want to read more of his work.

* **Fiction**
  * [Waiting for Godot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17716.Waiting_for_Godot) - Samuel Beckett
    * Interesting setup: "The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men simply waiting for someone—or something—named Godot."
  * [The Catcher in the Rye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye) - J.D. Salinger
    * Saw on many people's bookshelf.
  * [The Picture of Dorian Gray](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5297.The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray) - Oscar Wilde
    * Been sitting in my Kindle for years.
  * [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow) - Gabrielle Zevin
    * Comes recommended by Mr. Raghuram Rajan's daughter, perhaps good enough that he mentioned it in the year-end special TOI segment! Also a [Goodreads 2023 Choice Award winner](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-fiction-books-2022).
