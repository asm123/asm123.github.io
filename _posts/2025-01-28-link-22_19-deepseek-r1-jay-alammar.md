Jay Alammar explains with illustrations, high-level details of the [DeepSeek-R1 model](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120) that has shook the AI world and apparently [wiped off more than $1 trillion in market cap](https://fortune.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-buzz-puts-tech-stocks-on-track-for-1-trillion-wipeout/). 

LinkedIn is buzzing with posts explaining DeepSeek-R1 following the release of their technical paper: [on github](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf), [on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948). I chose to read Jay Alammar's because it explained the high-level details with newbie-friendly illustrations.
