## Chapter 4. Finite Time

### Synopsis

* Take on the work that is important to the company and important to you. Your needs are important and you are the person with the most incentive to watch out for them. 
* Taking care of your needs is compatible with being a team player because you will do better work if the projects keep you happy.
* Five resources to manage: energy, quality of life, credibility, social capital, skills.
* Ways to amplify the positives, decrease the negatives, saying no.

### Time

* Everything you commit to has an opportunity cost.
* Try to leave at least a little buffer space if you can for unplanned extra obligations.
  * If your schedule is filled with only important things, an unplanned event will cause hitting your limit and dropping something important.
  * Working beyond limits will cause stress and exhaustion.
  * Looking for longer-term needs a bigger picture of the month or quarter - a time graph.

### Resource constraints

1. **Energy**: Understand what kinds of work are expensive to you in terms of energy and what kinds leave you with *smartbrain* at the end of day - energy to stay focused on a piece of work and do something useful with it.

2. **Quality of life**: Not all of your quality of life should come from your work, but it is reasonable to want to feel good about it.

3. **Credibility**: Built by solving hard problems, being visibly competent and consistently showing good technical judgement.
   - ⬆ Taking a chaotic situation and making it easier for everyone to understand.
   - ⬇ Contributing to the chaos, not doing a good job of navigating the failure when a project goes badly, ignoring the big picture and business needs.
   - It is important to be aware of your credibility score and establish that you know what you are doing.

4. **Social capital**: Whether others want to help you do whatever you are trying to do.
   - It is a mix of trust, friendship and the feeling of owing someone a favor or believing that they will remember that they owe you one.
   - Invest your social capital wisely, spend it deliberately.

5. **Skills**: Always slowly decreasing. Increase the skills bar by deliberately setting out to learn something, working closely with someone skilled, learning by doing.

> You will optimize for different resources at different times. Pay attention to what any new project/task/initiative will do for each of your resources.

The bigger the project, the longer you should spend thinking about whether it is a good fit in terms of your resources.

### Choosing projects

* Evaluating a project:
  * Go ask for the project if you want if you think you are the best fit for it.
  * Helping out in a crisis is often the right thing to do. But doing too much of it can make it hard to find opportunities for growth.
  * When blocked on a bigger work, solving small, easy problems on the side can be a great way to build up momentum again. Too much of this kind of work can keep you away from longer-term projects.
  * Working groups for a grassroots effort can be effective if buy-ins, commitments and decision processes are clear. Will be a waste of time if it is a big group of overallocated people without the power of changing things that bother them.
  * Some work doesn't belong to anyone. Volunteering for such work can build credibility and goodwill. Don't do too much of it at the expense of other results expected from you.

> Other people have limited access to your resource dashboard. You are responsible for taking care of your own resources.

* What are you signing up for?
  * Understand the shape of a new project/task/meeting (basically anything that blocks your time) and ask yourself what impact it will have on your time - both now and later.
  * Be cautious about time estimation. Account for about the time required for possibly preparing for this time commitment. For example, a 1 hour meeting may need some time for preparation as well, add that to the estimated time commitment.
  * Exit criteria are especially important for risky work.

* Questions to ask yourself about projects:
  * **Energy**: 
    * How many things are you already doing?
    * Does this kind of work boost or drain your energy?
      * Do not snack
      ![Resource dashboard](/assets/images/staff-engineers-path/impact-quadrant.png)
    * Is this fight worth it?
  * **Quality of life**:
    * Do you enjoy this work? - intense and high stakes vs predictable, working alone vs collaborating with group(s), will you get to work with people who make you comfortable and safe?
    * How do you feel about the project's goals? Understand the positive and negative effects of your work on the world and weigh up how it affects your own satisfaction.
  * **Credibility**: Does this project use you technical and leadership skills?
  * **Social capital**:
    * Is this the kind of work expected by your manager and company at your level?
      * Help your boss be successful - Understand their priorities, give them the information they need, solve the problems in their way. Their success gives them the social capital that they can spend to help you. Manage up!
    * Will this work be respected?
    * Are you squandering the social capital you have built?
  * **Skills**:
    * Will this project teach you something you want to learn?
    * Will the people around you raise your game? - Look at whether you'll work for people you'll learn something from and people who will inspire you to do your best work.

* What if it is the wrong project? Possible approaches: 
  * Do it anyway - popular, but not sustainable in long-term.
  * Accept the project and compensate the needs it does not meet with a side-project.
  * Delegate and let someone else lead.
  * Resize and reshape the project in a way that can work for you.
  * Just don't do it. Learn to say no.

> When you choose a project, make sure you have enough of the resources you will need to do a good job. Defend you time, be deliberate about what you prioritize.
