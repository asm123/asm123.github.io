Just discovered the "Read Aloud" feature in the Google app on iOS to read aloud webpage content! iPhone has a native "Speak Screen" which sounds quite robotic and ends up reading literally everything on the screen - even the links or embedded YouTube videos - which mars the listening experience. Google app's "Read Aloud" reads only relevant stuff and sounds much less robotic. 

However, it doesn't work on a few sites, some Substack posts for example. iPhone's "Speak Screen" can be a fallback for such cases. Thinking of exploring both further over the next few days and maybe post an article comparing the usability.
