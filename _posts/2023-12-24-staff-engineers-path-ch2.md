## Chapter 2. Three Maps

### Synopsis

* The maps to have continual context and a sense of what is going on:
  1. Locator map: your place in the wider organization and company.
  2. Topgraphical map: navigating an organization - robust knowledge of what's ahead - how leaders operate, how decisions are made, org charts.
  3. Treasure map: taking a long view and evaluating the purpose of your work.

### Locator map: getting perspective
* Risks of being too focused on work in your own scope:
  1. Prioritizing badly - focusing on only local maximum
  2. Losing empathy - considering other teams' work unimportant
  3. Tuning out the background noise - stopping to notice problems in your own domain
  4. Forgetting the purpose of your work - losing sight of whole picture and if the project is still required
* How to see the bigger picture?
  * Take an outsider view of your own group - do technical decisions make sense?
  * Seek out peers in other groups, build friendly relationships with other staff engineers within and outside the org, find out if there are any negative opinions about your group. Befriend non-eng folks such as product, customer support, admins.
  * Know implicit as well as explicit goals that matter to the company/org right now.
  * Measure success from user's point of view.
  * Study what other have already done for this problem within and outside the org.
* How to keep seeing the big picture with changing priorities - pay attention to all-hands, have 1:1s with the skip, find face time with customers and dependent teams.

### Topographical map: navigating the organization
* Difficulties without a topographical map:
  * Good ideas don't get traction - should know how to build momentum within the org, who can sponsor the idea.
  * Not finding out about difficulties until getting there.
  * Everything takes longer - should know times of year when decision making is quicker.

#### Understanding the organization
* Seven attributes to understand the culture:
   1. Secret or open - how much does everyone know.
   2. Oral or written - how much writing and review is involved in decisions.
   3. Top-down or bottom-up
   4. Fast change or deliberate change - frame initiatives accordingly.
     * Fast - incremental path that shows value immediately
     * Deliberate - show that you've thought through the whole plan
   5. Communication channels
   6. Staffing
     * Understaffed - better impact working alone or with little help.
     * Many free cycles - better impact if choosing and finishing a nascent project and convincing others to rally it around.
   7. Liquid or crystallized
     * Liquid: more room to change your place in the org, but need to hustle for promotion.
     * Crystallized: need to know your place and when your time will come for a promo project.

* What do leaders consider important - figure out from how efforts are rewarded or rewarded, and resources are allocated.
* How does information flow in the org?
  * Pathologically - power and status are goals -> people hoard info, low co-operation. 
  * Bureaucratically - standard channels, rule-oriented -> change is difficult
  * Generatively - mission-oriented, high-trust, high co-operation.

#### Notice points of interest
* Understand points of interest = barriers, difficult parts of journey, shortcuts.

* Points of interest:
  * Gaps between teams in terms of culture, practices, goals.
  * Gatekeepers that seem to block projects. Get a sponsor for help, prove that you've mitigated all the risks.
  * Lack of alignment, overlapping responsibilities -> power struggles and wasted efforts.
  * A project may have been tried before and found unwinnable - should have enough evidence to convince that it can be won.
  * Shortcuts and long ways around - official way of solving may not be the best, shortcuts may be unknown or undocumented.

* How are decisions made?
  * Consistently feeling out of loop -> you don't understand how decisions are made and who influences them.
  * Need to convince *right* people.
  * Finding the "room" where decisions are made - weekly manager's meeting, director's meeting, group chats, senior 1:1s.
  * Joining the room:
    * Reasons to join the room should be impactful to the org, not to you personally.
    * Don't make anyone regret inviting you. Reduce the cost of joining: be prepared, speak concisely, be low-friction and collaborative.
  * The "room" may have less power than you think.


* Shadow org chart - who influence the technical leaders and how they make decisions.
  * Identify the influencers and get their buy-in.

* Keeping map up-to-date: announcements and mailing lists, connect with teams around, lookup leads' calendars, meeting notes, group chats, read PRDs, design docs, meet with leads, coffee chats.

* Networking is important - ask questions, compliment, coffee chats.

* Bridge connections
  * Sending email summary, write documentations that show how projects connect.
  * Define the work scope so that it encompasses all or some system or problem domain - helps get context to form opinions on decisions.


### Treasure map: where are we going?

* Need perspective about the world around across time.
* Don't think only about short-term wins. Take a longer view as well.
* Choose technology *to reach the real goal*.
* Share the treasure map with others.

### Action Items

* Understand how my org works.
