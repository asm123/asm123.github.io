## Chapter 1. What Would You Say You Do Here?

  - See the big picture.
  - Lead projects that cross multiple teams.
  - Be a good influence - set standards with good behaviour, code and design reviews.
* Defining the role, scope, shape and focus.

---

### What is the job?

- Involved and invested in growing technicall skills of engineers around them, but not responsible for managing their performance.
- Leadership - designing solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes, reviewing code and designs, setting technical direction. 
  - *Having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people because they trust you.*
- Solid foundation of technical skills.
  - Have high standards for engineering excellence and model them while building.
  - Take on ambiguous, difficult problems and do just enough work to make them manageable by someone else -> make it a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers.
  - What matters is that problems get solved, not how.
- Be autonomous
  - Manager brings you information and share context, you tell them what's important and create the high-impact work.
  - Bring your expertise to your decisions.
  - Be responsible - speak up if you foresee a disaster with decisions.
- Set technical direction
  - Ensure decisions are made well and written down - there is an agreed upon, well-understood solution that solves the problem at hand.
- Communicate often and well - convey information and be understood.

### Understanding the role

#### Reporting structure
- Reporting high: reporting to a director or VP.
  - 👍🏼 Gives broad perspective, access to high-level and impactful info, valuable learning experience.
  - 😔 Less time from manager, less visibility into the work -> less advocacy for growth, may feel disconnected from the rest of the team.
- Reporting low:
  - 👍🏼 Focused attention from manager -> more advocacy for growth
  - 😔 May be hard to influence the whole organization, access to filtered info, may have less to learn -> may not be helpful for career growth
  - ✅ Ensure to have meetings with skip-level manager, find ways to stay connected with org's goals.

#### Scope

* Should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals within your scope.
* Should have opinions about changes.
* Should help cultivate and develop next generation of senior and staff engineers, suggest projects to help them grow.
* Be clear about what your scope is: work at finer granularity, or operate at a high level and tie together all the work happening in the org.

> No such thing as "not my job" during a crisis. Part of the value of a staff engineer is that you don't stay in your lane.

* Too broad or undefined scope: lack of clear impact, becoming a bottleneck, constant cost of deciding which thing to do, missing friendly / mentorship connections with other engineers.
* Too narrow scope: lack of impact due to working on something that doesn't need the staff expertise, possibility of losing opportunities elsewhere in the org, not enough work to keep you busy -> overshadowing other engineers' work, overengineering due to lack of work.

> Choose an area, build influence, have success there. Devote time to solving problems entirely.

#### Shaping the role

* Do you approach things breadth-first or depth-first?
* Where do you gravitate - core technical skills, product management, project management, people management?
  * More senior you get, more there is an expectation of fluidly shifting between these 4 jobs and function in all of them.
* How much do you want to or need to code?
* How is your delayed gratification?
* Do you want to be a TLM?
* Do any of the staff archetypes fit you - tech leads, architects, solvers, right hands?

#### Primary focus

* What to choose:
  * At staff, everything you do has an opportunity cost -> work you do must be strategically important and meaningful.
  * Choose a problem that actually needs you and will benefit from your attention.

* What to avoid:
  * Projects with already many senior people on it.
  * Projects with more people being the wise voice of reason than those actually working on it.

### Action Item

* Figure out if your mental model of your role is aligned with the expecations of your manager and colleagues.
  * Write out your understanding of your role and check with the manager if the expectations are aligned - primary focus, goals, example responsibilities, success criteria.
