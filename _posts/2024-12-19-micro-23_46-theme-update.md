Tried to update the site theme to ["just-the-docs"](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) today, and broke build and deployment in the process. All is well now thanks to the fix [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/67813#discussioncomment-8991597). My wiki looks more beautiful than ever!

And has a built-in search too! ❤️
