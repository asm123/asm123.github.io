I moved to Switzerland a few months ago as a dependent to my partner and one of the requirements to renew my dependent visa is to get a minimum of A1 spoken proficiency in German. So I appeared for the exam and got A2 in Fide last month! 

The way the exam goes is, they start with A2 level questions and depending on your responses, they either switch further questions down to A1, or up to B1. As it turns out, my spoken German was better than I thought and they recommended me to try A2/B1! I chose to stay on the A1/A2 track and got A2 at 83% score. 

Here is why I chose to stay on A1/A2 track in the exam:

1. I already knew most of the questions they asked in the exam for the spoken part because my teacher (wish her a lot of happiness!) had prepared me well for those.
2. I needed this certificate to renew my visa and needed it kind of soon. I was afraid I would have to reappear if I failed this time and wouldn't get results in time.
3. My German listening comprehension isn't too great.

So yeah, I basically [chickened out](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/fb625d9f-4e3c-4b0c-9229-fc88bcc02863). Pardon the swear word in the clip!

But, it did motivate me to at least learn up to B1 level and try going for the certification another time. And I anyway love learning languages. So, I am now declaring 2025 to be my year of learning German to reach B1-level proficiency in German!

For now, I plan to study on my own since my company-sponsored language learning lessons have already ended. If it turns out too difficult to do it on my own, then might try joining a course.

I am thinking of following these study guides:
- [Yan Zamlynskyi's prep guide on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@yanzamlynskyi/post/DBzAlepoviq)
- [This detailed prep guide from a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/cc9dhm/b1_self_study_guide/)

I am also loving these Easy German playlists for revising some of my existing vocabulary and grammar:
- [German A1 \| For Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk1fjOl39-50kWobutO8NVFzbw9PHtbbg)
- [German A2 \| For Advanced Beginners](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk1fjOl39-5201BUdhtOM_x23poNvLouT)

And then, after working through these two, I will try this:
- [German B1 \| For Intermediate Learners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk1fjOl39-53yooogv6RaJAK29mx7nz1d)

And because I love following a structured approach using a book, I am going to take the advice from the Reddit thread linked above and work through the "Menschen B1 Kursbuch, Hueber" book.

To keep myself accountable, I will try posting my progress on the website at least a few times each month.

So los geht's!!!
