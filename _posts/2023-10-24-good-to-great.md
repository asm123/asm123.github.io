* Book: [Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/76865)
* Author: Jim Collins
* Published in: 2001

## Official Summary

> This book addresses a single question: can a good company become a great company, and if so, how? Based on a five-year research project comparing companies that made the leap to those that did not, Good to Great shows that greatness is not primarily a function of circumstance but largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline. This book discusses concepts like Level 5 Leadership; First Who, Then What (first get the right people on the bus, then figure out where to drive it); the Hedgehog Concept, and the Flywheel.
