*Note: This is a rant. You've been warned.*

<hr>

Trying to read anything online these days:

- Open a news website, you are presented with the platter of cookies - the cookie consent box. 
- Get past that, a log-in / subscribe pop-up is ready to pull you into the system. 
- Decline to do all that, now the website wants to know your location. 
- Block that, now the website wants to send you notifications. 
- Decline that and finally get to the article, some recommended video starts playing in the bottom right. 
- Start reading the article, the website wants you to click "Read more" to reveal the full article. 
- Now you have the whole article in one-piece, they recommend you another article, right in the middle of the one you were already reading.
- Finally you finish reading the article and decide to go back to the place you landed here from. Well, you can't, because this website has decided to insert in your browser history a "Before you go..." page with absolute garbage. So now you must click your back button at least twice to go back to wherever you came from.

Maybe that's why I am finding more joy on static personal websites these days.
