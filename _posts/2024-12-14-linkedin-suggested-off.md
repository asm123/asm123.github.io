### TL;DR

Me (your photo) -> Settings & Privacy -> Account Preferences -> scroll to "General Preferences" -> Preferred Feed View -> select "Most recent posts"


### Context

One of the things that annoys me the most on social media platforms is the "Suggested" posts. These are the posts from accounts that you do not follow, but the platform thinks you might like. When signal-to-noise ratio in the feed is already low, I do not want to be subjected to further website-recommended noise. I will follow who I want to follow. My business is my business, none of your business ðŸ˜¤

So when LinkedIn started putting "Suggested" posts on my feed recently, I had to do something about it. Over the last few years, I have carefully unfollowed or muted my connections which consistently posted content that I gained nothing from. After a lot of those iterations, my feed is finally at a level that I can open LinkedIn everyday and not see sheer garbage. Thankfully, LinkedIn does provide a way to turn these "Suggestions" off -- at least as of December 2024.

Tada! Potential incoming garbage deterred!
