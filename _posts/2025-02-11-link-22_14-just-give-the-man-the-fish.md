Well said! StackOverflow used to be full of such behaviour when I tried asking questions there a few years ago. I love this takeaway from the article:

> If one really wants people to read the manual, a much better strategy would be to answer the question, and then having established oneself as a helpful person, suggest the manual.

That said, in my experience, this works only with people who are willing to refer the suggested manual next time they have a related question. A few times, I have had to work with people who would _never_ use that suggestion and instead would have to be handheld and spoonfed all the time.
