## Chapter 3. Creating the Big Picture

### Synopsis

* Creating the missing map:
  * Technical vision - the future you want to get to
  * Technical strategy - how to get there
* Chapter talks about the need for these documents, preparation work for writing them, getting alignment and launching.

---

### Decentralized decision making
* Pros:
  * Organizations can move quickly.
  * Make own decisions.
* Cons:
  * Local maximum without coordinating with other leads.
  * No one group as authority or incentive -> shared concerns can be neglected.
  * Context missing for decision making.

### Technical Vision
* Describes the future (aka north star) once problems are solved and objectives are achieved.
  * Creates a shared reality.
  * Removes sources of conflict or ambiguity.
* What does a technical vision include:
  * A description of high-level values and goals
  * A set of principles to use for making decisions
  * A summary of decision already made
  * An architectural diagram

> Should be clear, opinionated and meet organization's needs.

### Technical Strategy
* Clean plan for action to achieve the goals and tackling challenges in the path.
  * Address specific challenges in realistic ways
  * Provide strong direction
  * Define actions to be prioritized along the way
  * Should draw on your advantages - amplify advantages in self-reinforcing way (ðŸ¤” didn't quite understand this part).
* Kernel of a strategy:
  1. Diagnosis of the problem - what's going on here.
  2. Guiding policy - clear directions to bypass the obstacles.
  3. Coherent actions - specific actions to be taken and not to be taken. These are the actions to which time and resources should be committed.

> Should be realistic and acknowledge the constraints of your situation.

### When are vision and strategy documents required?

* Path is undefined and confusing.
* Goals are not clear.
* Tough to get alignment from the group on a plan.

> Writing these documents is time-consuming. If same can be achieved in a lightweight way, go that way instead.

### Approach to creating the documents

* Be prepared to involve existing ideas.
  * Weigh up all possible solutions, make the case for what to do and not to do, align everyone and make the decision.
* Don't compete if someone else is already working on creating a similar document. Find ways to collaborate - share the lead, follow the lead or step away.
  * Practice perspective: is their direction wrong, or just different?
  * Try to join the existing journey and change direction instead of setting up competition from scratch.
* Get a sponsor.
  * Sponsor helps clarify and justify the work, adds hierarchy to groups to get consensus, sets success criteria, acts as a tiebreaker for stuck decisions.
  * Maximize chances to get a sponsor by bringing something they want - match the proposal to the sponsor's own goals or problems they care about. Maybe align to the organization's [treasure map](/2023/12/24/staff-engineers-path-ch2#treasure-map-where-are-we-going).
  * Practice the "elevator pitch" of 50 words before trying to convince the sponsor.
  * A sponsor needs the power to decide what an org spends time and staffing on - usually a director or VP.
  * Maintain the sponsorship.
* Choose the working groups:
  * Core group - 2-4 people - to create the document
    * Use the [topographical map](/2023/12/24/staff-engineers-path-ch2#topographical-map-navigating-the-organization) to identify who should be on your side, who might oppose. Bring along the potential opposers on your side from the start.
    * Be clear and highlight *from the start* whether you are the lead of the group or an equal peer.
  * Broad group - lightweight involvement - for alignment and supoort
    * Keep them enagaged: interview them and represent their point of view in the work
    * Send them updates on the progress on the document.
    * Invite to review the early draft.
* Set scope:
  * Be conscious of your skill level and scope of influence.
  * If the plan covers areas outside of your sphere of influence, make sure to have a sponsor with influence in that area - ideally in the core group for that area.
  * Be prepared to revisit the vision at intervals to ensure it is aligned with the organization's direction.
  * Choose the document type and format that makes sense to you and *the sponsor*.
  > Work around your fixed constraints instead of ignoring them or wishing they were different.
* Make sure it is achievable - is the problem solvable at all? Is it solvable by you? If not:
  * Work with someone who has the skills to solve - lead or co-lead with them.
  * Rescope the problem as per the constraints.
  * Work on something else if it is ok for the org/company to not have this problem solved.
* Make it official:
  * Do not continue if any of the above is not possible.
  * Formally set up kickoff documentation, milestones, timelines and expectations for reporting progress.

### Writing the document

* Revisit the document regularly to see what context has changed.

#### Writing
* Initial ideas
  * Inherit the constraints from broader visions and strategies. Use the [locator map](/2023/12/24/staff-engineers-path-ch2#locator-map-getting-perspective).
  * Include paths to success for the organization's existing plans, be aware of smaller scope documents to understand the potential disruptions.
  * Understand what is diffcult and needs to change, where should your group be investing.
  * Ensure to retain the things that are currently working well.
  * What is important, what matters?
  * What will future you wish that present you had done?
* Writing - possible ways
   1. Have the leader write the first draft for discussion - talk to the group before starting to write.
   2. Aggregate multiple first drafts - set expectations about who will write the final version and mediate disagreements.
* Interviews
  * Talk to leaders, influencers and people close to the work in other areas - value their ideas and include them in the document.
  * Ask open-ended questions for scoping and framing.
* Thinking
  * Check motivations - are you describing a problem in terms of the solution you have already chosen?
  * Ask "but why?" over and over again until you are sure the explanation maps back to the goal to be achieved.

#### Make decisions
* Clarify and weigh trade-offs.
* Build consensus
  * Take a sense of the group, try to get aligned, but don't block on full consensus.
  * Instead of "Is everyone ok with choice A?", ask "Can anyone not live with choice A?".
  * Important to have someone with clear leadership authority that can act as a tiebreaker - can be the sponsor.
* Postponing or not deciding
  * What extra information do you expect to make a decision and how? What could go wrong? Can it be course-corrected?
  * Usually don't need to make the best decision, just a good enough decision.
  * Timebox if stuck.
  * When not to decide - if the investment is not worth the benefits, if mistakes carry heavy penalty, if situation can go away on its own. *Decide to not decide.*
* Show your work - show why you chose what you chose, be clear about the disadvantages.

#### Alignment
* Keep the sponsor up to date on the plan and progress.
* Check the alignment at major checkpoints - diagnosis, guiding policy, actions.
