## Chapter 8 - The Flywheel and the Doom Loop

* Good-to-great transformations are not results of one fell swoop or overnight success. They are organic development process, sometimes more than a decade in making.
* Flywheel effect: Continued improvement and delivery, tangible accomplishments build up the momentum and attract the enthusiasm of people.

* Big acquisitions should take place after development of [Hedgehog Concept](/2023/10/22/good-to-great-ch5) and after the flywheel builds significant momentum.
  * Use acquisitions as an accelerator of flywheel momentum, not a creator of it.
* Consistency and coherence over time yield maximum results.
