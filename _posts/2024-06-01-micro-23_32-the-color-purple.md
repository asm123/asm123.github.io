`#FinishedABook`

Finished reading [The Color Purple](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52892857-the-color-purple) a few days ago.

As is usually the case with me and popular books, this one too did not quite captivate me much. The story was building up well during the first half, but the second half derailed quite badly. So badly that I did not even realize that the characters had grown by almost 30 years over the span. Timelines felt way too blurry and unfathomable.

That said, this book features several strong women characters and buildup of their character to their strength is impressive. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ for that.

By the way, when I was reading the book, I imagined that the character of Shug Avery might look like Taraji P. Henson. Surprise surprise! Turns out Taraji P. Henson does play Shug Avery in the latest [musical adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_Purple_(2023_film)) of the book!
