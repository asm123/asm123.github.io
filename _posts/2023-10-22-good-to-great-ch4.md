## Chapter 4 - Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)

- Continually refine the path to greatness with the brutal facts of reality.
- Charismatic personality can be as much as liability as an asset.
  - The strength of personality can deter people from bringing the brutal facts.
- Opportunity to "Have your say" vs opportunity "to be heard".

- Creating a climate where truth is heard:
  1. Lead with questions, not answers
     - Having humility to accept the fact that you do not understand enough to have the answers.
     - Asking questions that will lead to best possible insights.
     - Instead of coming up with answers and motivating everyone to follow that vision.
  2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion:
     - Debate in search for the best answers.
     - Instead of discussions to get a buy-in for a predetermined decision.
  3. Blameless autopsies:
     - You should almost never assign a blame.
     - Only search for understanding and learning.
  4. Build red flag mechanisms:
     - More or better information makes no different between good and great companies.
     - Turn the information into information that cannot be ignored.


- Stockdale Paradox
  - Retain the faith that you will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties.
  - At the sane time, confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.
