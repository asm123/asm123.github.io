### As a new team member

Situation: New on a team, not fully aware of priorities, waiting for concrete work items to be assigned.

1. Read up company / org / team strategy
2. Ramp up on codebase from team members' code changes
3. Read up existing engineering documentation for immediate area or related areas
4. Fix documentation on the go
5. Add missing documentation
6. Try to contribute to low-hanging bugs / tasks from recent launches

### As a seasoned team member

Situation: Seasoned team member, org priorities or projects are not finalized due to factors not under your direct control.

1. Revisit any low-hanging bugs / tasks previously left out (if still relevant)
2. Cleanup tech debt
3. If general direction of the org is known but projects are not yet formalized, ramp up on the related areas through documentation, code
   1. Educate others on the areas with lightning talks or 1:1 discussions
   2. Use insights from this ramp-up to support your manager in the OKR and project planning with eng details
4. Use your product to check if it is still true to expectations
5. Add observability into launched features if still relevant
6. Offer help to team members
7. Brainstorm new ideas on related areas
