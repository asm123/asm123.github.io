Collecting digital gardens, personal websites and blogs has become my hobby in recent years. Apparently such a list is called [blogroll](https://www.google.com/search?q=blogroll+meaning). I visit the websites in this list occasionally to get inspiration for design and content structure. I have not necessarily subscribed to their content.
