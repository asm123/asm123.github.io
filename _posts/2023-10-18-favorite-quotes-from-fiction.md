> “We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”

― Fredrik Backman, [A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove)

> “And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps.”

― Fredrik Backman, [A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove)
