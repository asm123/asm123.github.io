## Chapter 9 - From Good to Great to Built to Last

* This chapter links the ideas from the author's other book [*Built to Last*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4122.Built_to_Last) with the findings of this book.
* Key ideas from *Built to Last*:
  1. Clock building, not time telling: build an organization that can endure and adapt through multiple generations of leaders and product life cycles.
  2. Genius of AND: embrace both extremes on a number of dimensions at the same time, e.g., purpose AND profit, continuity AND change, freedom AND responsibility.
  3. Core ideology: instill core values and purpose to guide decisions and inspire people.
  4. Preserve the core / stimulate progress: set and achieve BHAG - *Big Hairy Audacious Goals* - with the core ideology.

* Practically, *Good to Great* serves as a prequel to *Build to Last*. Apply "Good to Great" principles to create sustained results and then apply "Build to Last" to be an enduring great company.

* Enduring great companies preserve their core values and purpose while endlessly adapting their business strategies and operating practices to a changing world.
* Core values are essential to greatness. It does not matter what core values you have, but that:
  1. you have core values at all,
  2. you know what they are,
  3. build them explicitly into the organization,
  4. preserve them over time.

* Bad BHAGs are set with bravado, good BHAGs are set with understanding - [Hedgehog Concept](/2023/10/22/good-to-great-ch5).
* Enduring greatness requires staying squarely within three circles and also being willing to change the specific manifestation of what's inside the three circles at any given moment. For example, Boeing started with military jets and later included commercial aircrafts.
