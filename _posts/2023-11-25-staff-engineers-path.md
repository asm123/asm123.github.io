* Book: [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) by [Tanya Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyareilly/)


## Synopsis

Three pillars of staff engineer role:
  1. Big-picture thinking
  2. Execution of projects
  3. Leveling up the engineers you work with

Technical knowledge is not enough at this level. You need "humaning skills" such as communication, leadership, navigating complexity, perspective, delegation, mentorship, sponsorship, framing a problem so that other people care about it.

> All of these skills are learnable.
