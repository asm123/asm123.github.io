## Local Guides on Google Maps

[Google Local Guides](https://maps.google.com/localguides/) is a volunteer program in Google Maps where one can contribute to Google Maps by sharing ratings, reviews, photos for places. These places can be anything that is on the map such as restaurants, malls, stores, hospitals, etc. Apart from ratings, one can also suggest edits to names, website, contact info for the places, Google then verifies these edits and incorporates into the map if found valid.

While I mentioned Local Guides here, such contributions are possible on a lot of other platforms such as Zomato, TripAdvisor, etc.

#### Effort level
Low.

#### Fun part
For every contribution, you get certain number of [points](https://support.google.com/local-guides/answer/6225851?hl=en) and [level](https://support.google.com/local-guides/answer/6225851?hl=en). Google used to give away perks such as free Google Drive storage if you reach a certain Local Guide level. This was few years ago, don't know if the perks program is still ongoing. Nevertheless, it is fun to contribute and keep leveling up. A low effort way to be a Maps Influencer!!!

#### Helpful part
1. Reviews help future visitors for the place make a decision.
2. Reviews can help boost traffic to businesses, especially helpful for small businesses.
3. While Google Maps has a wide coverage of places in most parts of India, it does not necessarily have correct info for places and businesses in small towns. Contributing information can help make Google Maps useful for people in such places too.
4. I have often observed that Google Maps does not have names for places transliterated correctly in my native language of Marathi which leads to weird names on Maps. For example, long ago, I saw "ICICI Bank" transliterated as "इच्चीच्ची बँक" (ee-chi-chi bank) instead of "आयसीआयसीआय बँक" (I-C-I-C-I bank). Correcting or adding non-English names can improve discovery of places in non-English languages.
5. Adding information about wheelchair accessibility, vegetarian options can make searching places for personalized needs easier.

## Add details to OpenStreetMap with MissingMaps
[MissingMaps](https://www.missingmaps.org/)

#### Effort level
Low.

#### Fun part
MissingMaps has different tasks for mapping such as buildings, roads, houses which can help learn how maps are made. You can host mapathons, earn points and compete with other mappers across the world.

#### Helpful part
Maps remote and vulnerable communities which can now be traced by humanitarian organizations for rescue and relief.

## Localise Wikipedia
Who doesn't love reading Wikipedia? Anybody can contribute to Wikipedia with adding/editing bits of information, if not the whole page. The edits are then reviewed and then added to our beloved knowledge platform.

#### Effort level
Low.

#### Fun part
Get your favorite people, things, concepts and places on the largest encyclopedia around. Improves writing skills. Improves knowledge.

#### Helpful part
Having been around for over two decades, there is now a page for almost everything on Wikipedia. Almost. The coverage for small towns, non-celebrities, little-known places and Indian languages is still low. By adding bits of information, one can:
1. Improve the knowledge coverage for local things.
2. Make knowledge accessible in non-English languages.

## Crowdsource by Google

Contribute similar to Google Local Guides, but beyond maps. [Crowdsource](https://crowdsource.google.com/about/).

#### Effort level
Low.

#### Fun part
Another way to be an Influencer!

#### Helpful part
Digitize more of your local region, language, culture and make Internet accessible to everyone. Additionally, enhance AI capabilities.

## Share book notes in blogs
Benefits of reading books have been discussed in great lengths, perhaps the most for any hobby. I am not going to go into that. 

Reading is great. But I often forget about the content or learnings from a book after a few years. So recently, I have started making [notes](/tags/book-notes) for the books I am [currently reading](/bookshelf), at least the non-fiction ones and sharing those here in my digital garden. I also hope to someday create a podcast or YT channel for sharing these notes as book summaries.

#### Effort level
Varies. If you prefer eBooks, then most of the reading apps provide a way to highlight sections of the book which can double as your book notes. Depending on where and how you want to share these, efforts can vary. Here are a few examples:
1. Digital Garden: If you don't care much about the presentation and want to go the digital garden way, all you have to do is transcribe the notes into your public digital garden. Low effort.
2. Blog: If you want to make the notes better comprehensible for the readers, it may require a bit more effort to present the notes coherently. It may be medium effort in the beginning, but becomes easier over the time as you get into the groove of writing.
3. YT videos: High effort. Creating script for the video, making sure it is coherent, recording the video, editing it.
4. Podcast: High effort. Similar to YT.

#### Fun part
In addition to the obvious learning benefits, you get to pick up one more skill based on your presentation - better at writing, video editing, pronunciation, presentation and so on. Besides, which reader doesn't like bragging about the books they have read!

#### Helpful part
While I love reading a variety of books, I have often found difficult deciding whether I want to buy a non-fiction book just based on the synopsis. Other people's reviews don't help much either because everyone has different background and views for the content. If only somebody helped me with the highlights of the content so that I could form my own opinion of whether the book will be useful for me! Shared book notes do exactly that!
