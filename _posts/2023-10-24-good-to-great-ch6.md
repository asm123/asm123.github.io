## Chapter 6 - A Culture of Discipline

* Bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline. Avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy, instead create a culture of discipline.
* Never just focus on what you've accomplished this year; focus on what you've accomplished relative to exactly what you decided to accomplish.
* Build a culture full of people who take disciplined action consistent with the [Hedgehog Concept](/2023/10/22/good-to-great-ch5).
  * Disciplined people: Hire self-disciplined people.
  * Disciplined thought: Confront brutal facts of reality, retain faith that you can and will create a path to greatness. Persist the search for understanding until you get your Hedgehog Concept.
  * Disciplined action: Extreme diligence and stunning intensity. Fanatically adhere to the Hedgehog Concept.
* Develop a framework with clear constraints and give people freedom and responsibility within that framework.
* Disciplined culture != tyranny.
* Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity also has to fit in the three circles.
* Budgeting is a discipline to decide which arenas should be fully funded and which should not be funded at all.
* "Stop doing" list is more important that "to do" list.
