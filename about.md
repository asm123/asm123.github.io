Hi there!

I am Asmita and this is my little corner on the Internet. I am a software engineer, originally from India and currently living in Switzerland.

I always wanted to have a personal website to curate my learnings, thoughts, likes. But the thought of needing everything to be well-researched, camera-ready, and most of all -- absolutely correct, held me back for over a decade.

Then serendipitously, I came across two wonderful articles mid-2023 that changed my mind. First was the concept of digital gardens, specifically [this article](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) by Maggie Appleton. Soon afterwards, I landed on swyx's [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) rule.

This wonderful [github repo of digital gardens](https://github.com/lyz-code/best-of-digital-gardens) kicked away any hesitation still lurking around. Referring to a few digital gardens from this collection, I managed to build and nurture this little patch of land on the Internet.

## What goes here?

I post notes on material consumed from different sources, e.g., [notes](/tags/books) from the [books I am currently reading](/library), or [interesting podcasts](/tags/podcast), with due credit to the creators of the original material. These posts are here mainly for the ease of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and possibly discovering connections between different ideas.

A few times, I post [dev snippets](/tags/programming) commonly required in my day-to-day work, basic yet easy to forget. For example, I keep forgetting how to get current time in bash in a certain format. So I added a note here so that next time I need it, I can just look it up in my own note before searching elsewhere!

And finally, [Micro](/micro) is my chaotic and yet calming corner to post random flashes of thoughts or anything that gets me excited briefly.

As of January 2025, micros citing links across the web under are moved under [Linkblog](/links), taking inspiration from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark" target="_blank">Simon Willison's Blogmarks</a>. 

## Website

I love writing in Markdown. This site is a simple static website created using Github pages and Jekyll, which supports writing in Markdown. I wrote a [small tutorial](/2023/10/14/website-creation.html) for how-to. There is a [wishlist / todo list](/2023/12/24/site-todos.html) for the website and I try to make some progress on those once in a while.

## Notations

🌱 - first version of the note

🌿 - updated at least once since the first version

🌳 - complete, no major updates expected

🍃 - micro

🪴 - opinionated, possibly long-form essays

🔗 - link to something external that caught my interest

## Tracking

This website is really for my own learning and as such, I do not care if anyone ever or never visits it. There are no cookies 🍪, no trackers 🐾, no visitor analytics 📉. If you are here, feel free to wander about as you please. 

But do remember, pretty much everything around here is just a seed planted to someday grow into a tree or wither away 😊

Ciao!
