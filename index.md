Hi there!

Inspired by swyx's [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) rule, I have started creating my own personal wiki in public!

I post [dev snippets](/tags/dev) commonly required in my day-to-day work, basic yet easy to forget. For example, I keep forgetting how to get current time in bash in a certain format. So I added a note here so that next time I need it, I can just look it up in my own note before searching elsewhere!

I also post notes on material consumed from different sources, e.g., [notes](/tags/book-notes) from the [books I am currently reading](/bookshelf), or [interesting podcasts](/tags/podcast-notes), with due credit to the creators of the original material. These posts are here mainly for the ease of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and possibly discovering connections between different ideas.

And finally, [Micro](/micro) is my chaotic and yet calming corner to post random flashes of thoughts or anything that gets me excited briefly.

In summary, this website is really for my own learning and lookup, but if you find anything useful or interesting here, that's a bonus! Not everything is thoroughly researched or well thought out. Pretty much everything is a draft.
