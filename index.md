<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>Inspired by swyx's <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">Learn In Public</a> rule, I have started creating a learning exhaust on this space.</p>

<p>I am planning to post tutorials for dev things I have tried and maybe also dabble in some dev blogging. It is mostly going to be my in-progress notes on different topics.</p>
